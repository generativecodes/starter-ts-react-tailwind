# React TypeScript TailwindCSS Starter Template

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and uses TypeScript and TailwindCSS for rapid and type-safe development.

## Technologies Used

1. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that
   builds on JavaScript.
3. **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building
   custom designs.

## Directory Structure

- **public**: This folder contains the HTML file and images.
  You won't need to modify the HTML file in most cases.
- **src**: This is the main folder you will work in.
  It contains all your React components, styles, and logic.
- **node_modules**: This folder contains all the dependencies of your project.
- **package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies
  and configuration for the project.

## Key Files

- **src/index.tsx**: This is the entry point for the React application.
  It renders the root component to the DOM.
- **src/App.tsx**: The main application component.
  It's wrapped in the `BrowserRouter` component to enable routing.
- **src/index.css**: The main CSS file where TailwindCSS is imported.
- **tailwind.config.js**: The configuration file for TailwindCSS.
  You can customize your design constraints here.
- **postcss.config.js**: The configuration file for PostCSS.
  It is set up to use TailwindCSS and Autoprefixer.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode
and optimizes the build for the best performance.
